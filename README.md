EXPERIMENTS on the look-and-feel (from the point of view of the *developer experience*) of a few frameworks/libraries used to develop web services in Scala.

At the end of the day all the examples should have:
- a '/' endpoint that would return [1, 2, 3] (json)
- a '/:string' that would return "string" (for any string) (plaintext)
- a '/json' that would return {'message':'Hello, World!'} (json)
- a '/plaintext' that would return Hello, World!' (plaintext)
